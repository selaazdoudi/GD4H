# Literature review on healthy urban planning

The accessibility score we will construct needs to capture the availability of services which pertain to healthy urban planning. Thus, we decided to conduct a literature review to understand what the determinants of health are, how much each of them contributes to population health, and which ones have been incorporated in already existing attempts at building indices on accessibility and urban health. This will help to shed light on the relevant indicators or amenities to include in the construction of our score.

Acknowledging that policies must be based on an understanding of the determinants of health, Dahlgren and Whitehead created in 1991 a model of these determinants. The “Dahlgren and Whitehead model” of the main determinants of population health became over the last 30 years the most widely used model of its kind. The authors thought of these determinants as a series of four layers. The one which is most of interest for us is the second layer: these are the living and working conditions of people, determined by multiple sectors such as education, healthcare, employment or food production. Each of these “four layers of influence” translate into different levels of policy intervention, and the second layer corresponds to policies which aim to improve living and working conditions by targeting one or more sectors. For instance, this includes providing health care services, and employment policies. It focuses on improving the material and social conditions on which people’s livelihood and work are based.

According to a report by the LA County department of public health from 2013, a population’s health is influenced 20% by clinical health care (access to care and quality of care), and 40% by social and economic factors (such as education, employment and community safety).

Indices or indicators for accessibility to essential services linked to health and well-being have been developed in studies over the years. One of those indices is the “Urban Liveability Index” created by Higgs et al (2019). In their paper, the authors defined urban liveability as communities that are “safe, attractive, socially cohesive and inclusive, and environmentally sustainable; with affordable and diverse housing linked by convenient public transport, walking and cycling infrastructure to employment, education, public open space, local shops, health and community services, and leisure and cultural opportunities”. Thus, they identified 6 liveability domains: transport, social infrastructure, employment, walkability, housing and green infrastructure. Within transport, they included more specifically train stations, tram stops and bus stops. Within social infrastructure, they included amenities related to education (state primary schools and state secondary schools), to sport and recreation (sport center and swimming pools), to culture and leisure (cinemas, theatres, libraries), childcare centres, community centres, and health and social services (aged care, community health centres, dentists, GP clinics, maternal child health centres and pharmacies).

Regarding the more specific domain of social infrastructure, it is defined by Davern et al (2017) as “life-long social service needs related to health, education, early childhood, community support, community development, culture, sport and recreation, parks and emergency services”. The authors provided the following list of services comprised in this domain:

- **Health Services:** Hospitals, General Practitioners, Mental Health Services, Community Health Centres, Maternal and Child Health Centres, and Aged Care Facilities.

- **Education Services:** Lifelong learning including Kindergartens, Playgroups, Primary and Secondary Schools, Universities, Vocational and Technical Tertiary Education, University of the 3rd Age, Libraries.

- **Childcare:** Long Day Care, Occasional Care, and Out of Hours School Care.

- **Community Support Agencies:** Community Support Organisations and Centrelink.

- **Arts and Culture:** Movie theatres, art galleries, museums, and community art centres.

- **Formal Sport and Recreation:** Pools, gyms, indoor and outdoor facilities.

- **Public Open Space:** Parks and Playgrounds.

- **Community Development:** Community Centres, Neighbourhood Houses, Senior Citizens Centres, Youth Services, Home & Community Care.

- **Social Housing:** Public housing, transitional housing, and housing diversity to meet the needs of varied demographic profiles.

- **Employment**

- **Legal and Emergency Services:** Fire, Police, Ambulance, and Judicial Services.

- **Public and Community Transport:** Council Community Transport and planning that supports walking and cycling.


Based on a conceptual model they developed, they found that the spatial accessibility of social infrastructure positively impacts the health and wellbeing of residents.

## Description of our objectives
In the context of healthy urban planning, having accurate geographical data and accessibility metrics is essential for making informed decisions to provide all citizens with adequate access to amenities that enrich their life and improve their well-being. Thus, the objective of our project is to build a tool that assists users to visualise and better understand the distribution and the availability of services contributing to public health in the French territory. Users can range from private individuals, to authorities and policy makers. The latter can use this visualisation tool as guidance to improve their understanding of the level of accessibility in a given area and tailor their policies and decisions accordingly.
The first key feature of the tool is its ability to integrate geographical coordinates across France, including both metropolitan and overseas regions. By ensuring comprehensive geographic coverage, the tool will facilitate the collection and organization of spatial data, allowing for a detailed representation of locations across diverse regions. This allows users to work with location-based data regardless of the area they are visualising within France.
The second feature focuses on computing accessibility measures for various amenities relevant to healthy urban planning. The tool evaluates the availability of essential services such as healthcare facilities, grocery stores, train stations, or cultural centers. By quantifying accessibility, it helps identify gaps in service coverage and supports efforts to enhance equitable access to key resources. This feature is particularly valuable for urban developers and policymakers aiming to design cities or territories that promote well-being for all residents.

## Data description and exploration
Amenities Data: Base Permanente des Équipements (BPE)
The Base Permanente des Équipements (BPE) is a comprehensive dataset provided by INSEE, cataloging a wide range of public equipment and amenities across France. It is updated annually and covers the entire national territory, including both metropolitan France and overseas departments.
It includes over 200 types of amenities, spanning sectors such as transportation, healthcare, education, commerce, and public amenities, provides detailed geolocation and classification of amenities at a granular spatial level and facilitates analysis of territorial inequalities, access to amenities, and urban and rural infrastructure distribution. From this dataset a subset of service categories was selected based on relevance to urban urban accessibility and public well-being. There are around 2.8 million different amenities in the BPE dataset.

INSEE Carreaux dataset
The INSEE Carreaux dataset provides a high-resolution spatial grid called “carreaux” that covers the entire French territory, including overseas departments. Each carreaux is a 200m x 200m grid cell, enabling detailed spatial granularity. These are the smallest geographical units provided by INSEE that describe the population and housing distribution across France and DOMTOM. A carreau is present as long as there is one household present in the cell. For confidentiality reasons, carreaux that have less than 11 households present are imputed. These carreaux include socio-demographic information such as: population count, income levels, household composition and social housing indicators, among others. Carreaux are provided for metropole, La Réunion, and Martinique. There are over 2.3 million individual carreau in the dataset.
This spatial granularity allows for refined analysis of local accessibility inequalities, supports spatial joins with geolocated amenities (e.g., BPE amenities), and serves as the geographic foundation for computing accessibility and livability scores across France.

## Methodology
### Script that allows users to input their own data
The first step in our tool's workflow is allowing the user to input their own dataset. To achieve this, a function called “accept_user_file” was created to open a file selection dialog, enabling users to choose a file from their system. The function ensures that only relevant file formats are accepted, restricting the selection to CSV and TXT files, and loads the file into a dataframe.
We structured the data import process in a way that makes it user-friendly. The function utilizes a graphical interface, ensuring that users do not have to manually specify file paths. This simplifies the process by making the tool more accessible, especially for those who may not be familiar with command-line operations. Once the user selects a file, the function determines its format and loads it accordingly. This provides flexibility to the users while maintaining their data integrity. In cases where no file is selected, the program is designed to exit, preventing unnecessary errors. If an unsupported file type is chosen, the function raises an error message to guide the user toward the correct input format.
To increase flexibility further, fuzzy recognition functions were implemented to automatically identify latitude and longitude columns, no matter how they were spelled in the provided dataset. Since different datasets may use varying column names for the same type of information (e.g., "latitude" vs. "lat"), fuzzy matching techniques are applied to determine the best match: column names in the dataset are compared against a list of expected column names, using a similarity score to assess the likelihood of a match. The function iterates through the provided column options and selects the one with the highest similarity score, ensuring that minor differences in spelling do not prevent correct identification. If no strong match is found, it falls back on a default column name. If no suitable match is found, the function asks the user to manually verify the dataset to prevent errors. Once latitude and longitude columns as well as location names and categorical labels are identified, the function standardizes these column names by renaming them to a uniform format ("latitude," "longitude," "location," and "category"). This way, different data sources can be provided to the tool without requiring users to manually adjust column names. Additionally, it constructs a "geometry" column by converting the latitude and longitude coordinates into geometric points.
Overall, user intervention is minimal in this part of the process, ensuring a fast and optimized data preparation on which to build the rest of the workflow.

### Building isochrones
#### Configuration of OpenRouteService
OpenRouteService (ORS) is a highly customizable routing service written in Java. It utilizes freely available geographic data from OpenStreetMap, sourced through user contributions and collaborative efforts, to provide global spatial services: the calculation of routes, isochrones and distance matrices. It was developed in 2017 by the University of Heidelberg GIScience (Geoinformatics) Research Group. Since then, it has been used widely, including by certain renowned institutions such as The New York Times. Its proven reliability and widespread use motivated our choice of this service.
To successfully run ORS, a system must meet certain software and hardware requirements. It requires both Java and Python: Java is essential because ORS is built on Java-based technologies, and it relies on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to execute its core routing algorithms. Additionally, Python is used for sending requests to the ORS API, automating requests, and processing results. Regarding hardware requirements, one needs a high-performance processor and sufficient memory to run ORS efficiently. ORS relies heavily on in-memory data structures for handling routing graphs and on large datasets. This consumes significant memory. Therefore, it is recommended to use a computer equipped with an Intel Core i7 processor and at least 32GB of RAM.
We decided to run our own OpenRouteService instance locally as it allows us to customize its behavior and to not be limited by the query constraints of its public API, which is limited to 2500 queries per day and 40 queries per minute. There are different options to achieve this. The service can be built in the form of different artifact types: WAR, JAR or as Docker Image. We chose to use the JAR file version of ORS. With it, we can run unlimited requests per day. The ready-to-use JAR (v9.0.1) file can be downloaded through this link, from the “Assets” section of the desired release: https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice/releases.
We used a YAML configuration file, which is the recommended way to configure an ORS instance run plain using the JAR file. In a configuration file, we define the parameters for our customized ORS instance, ensuring that the routing engine operates efficiently and provides accurate results for three different transportation modes (car, bicycle, and pedestrian travel) and three different travel times (5, 10 and 15 minutes). The primary objective of this configuration is to set up ORS for accessibility analysis, which involves computing isochrones—areas of reachability within a given time or distance from given locations.
To optimize the performance of OpenRouteService (ORS), separate configuration files have been created for each transportation mode (driving-car, cycling-regular, and foot-walking) and for each region of the country. We chose this approach because running a single configuration file that includes all transportation modes and covers the entire country results in excessive processing time and resource consumption. By splitting configurations into smaller, region-specific files, ORS can operate more efficiently. Each configuration file defines the transportation mode applied (driving, cycling, or walking), the geographic region covered (e.g., Alsace, Brittany, Île-de-France), and the OpenStreetMap (OSM) dataset corresponding to that region.


##### Services configuration
The routing service enables the core functionalities of ORS, such as routing and isochrone computation. Therefore, it must be explicitly enabled in each configuration file. Each instance of ORS is set up to handle a specific transportation mode: the routing profile is either set as “driving-car”, “cycling-regular” or “foot-walking”. Only enabling the relevant mode avoids unnecessary computations for modes that are not required in the specific instance, which improves efficiency.


##### Engine configuration
The minimal valid configuration for ORS to run properly contains at least one enabled profile and an OSM data file as reference.
ORS relies on routing graphs built from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, which contain detailed geographic and transportation network information. The engine section defines how ORS processes geographic data, including the specific OSM dataset corresponding to a particular region which will be used for routing. In order to do this, the OSM dataset for the region is specified in the “source_file” section. It corresponds to an .osm.pbf file, downloaded from the following link: https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/france.html.
Moreover, the “profiles” section defines the selected routing profile (“driving-car”, “cycling-regular”, or “foot-walking). Here, we set the default routing profiles. The profiles are designed to reflect real-world conditions as accurately as possible for each transportation mode, which provides realistic and reliable route planning results.
When changing the geographic region for isochrone calculations, users are strongly advised to delete the cache files before running the system with a new dataset. If this is not done, the ORS engine may continue using previously stored latitude and longitude values from the old region, even if a new .osm.pbf file is used in the configuration. Deleting the cached data guarantees that the routing graph is correctly rebuilt, preventing incorrect routing results due to inconsistencies in geographic locations.

##### Endpoints configuration
ORS provides various API endpoints for different types of geospatial analyses, with isochrones being one of the main ones. The configuration file includes specific parameters that control how isochrones are generated and what limitations apply to their calculations. We enabled isochrone computations with the following settings:
“maximum_locations: 2” restricts isochrone calculations to two numbers of locations per request to prevent excessive computational load.
“maximum_intervals: 3” defines up to three time-based isochrone bands. For example, we wish to request isochrones at 5, 10, and 15-minute intervals.
We also enabled the “allow_compute_area” setting, which determines whether the polygon area covered by an isochrone should be computed in the response.
To enhance performance, the configuration also enables fast isochrone calculations. It allows for faster processing by optimizing the way distances and travel times are computed. The constraints imposed on isochrone calculations regarding time and distance are the following:
“maximum_range_distance_default: 50000” sets a default limit of 50 km for distance-based isochrones.
“maximum_range_time_default: 18000” allows up to 5 hours (18000 seconds) of travel time. This is particularly useful when it comes to walking or cycling-based isochrones.

##### Logging configuration
The logging section controls how ORS outputs system messages. We set the logging level to “INFO”, which ensures that relevant system messages, errors, and performance metrics are recorded without overwhelming the logs with unnecessary details.

##### Running OpenRouteService
Once the configuration files have been set up, ORS can be launched from the command line. To start the service, users must navigate to the directory where the ors.jar file is located and execute the following command:
	java -jar ors.jar
The system then begins processing the OSM dataset, constructing the necessary routing graphs, and preparing the API for requests. Once this process is completed, ORS is fully operational. Users will be able to query routes and generate isochrones according to the configured settings.

### Isochrone computation using OpenRouteService
Using OpenRouteService (ORS), we could automate the process of generating isochrones from our “carreaux” data. The isochrones are computed for centroids of the carreau, and the results are stored in a JSONL (JSON Lines) file. The computation follows five main steps, which we will discuss more in detail in this section: 
Setting parameters: Define ORS API settings, input data paths, and computation parameters.
Reading and reprojecting “carreaux” spatial data: Load the “carreaux” shapefile, reproject it, and compute centroids for isochrone computation.
Initialising ORS client: Establish connection with the local ORS instance we configured.
Computing isochrones: Query ORS to compute isochrone polygons based on “carreaux” centroid coordinates.
Post-processing: Convert the results into a structured GeoDataFrame for further analysis.

#### Configuration and parameter setting
The first step in the process involves defining the necessary parameters, including the ORS API configuration, input data paths, and computational settings.
The script starts by defining key parameters. The ORS instance runs on a locally hosted server, accessible via our base URL http://localhost:8082/ors. The user specifies a travel mode (driving-car, foot-walking or cycling-regular), which determines the routing algorithm used. The isochrone range (range_val) is set to 900 seconds (15 minutes), with intervals (interval_val) of 300 seconds (5-minute steps). This means that multiple nested isochrones will be computed.
A shapefile containing our spatial units (french “carreaux”) is provided as input. A JSONL file for the output is created as well. This file format allows for an efficient handling of large datasets by writing results line by line.

#### Loading and preparation of the “carreaux” spatial data
If the “carreaux” shapefile follows a different coordinate reference system (CRS) than EPSG:4326 (WGS84), it must be transformed into EPSG:4326 (WGS84) for compatibility with ORS. The data is therefore reprojected accordingly when necessary. The CRS of a shapefile can be retrieved by the following Python line using the geopandas package (considering a generic shapefile called “shapefile.shp”):
shapefile = gpd.read_file("shapefile.shp")
crs = shapefile.crs
It should be reminded that a shapefile (SHP format) should always be accompanied by in SHX, PRJ, DBF and CPG files in the same directory, or else the shapefile will not be read.
Each carreau represents a polygon. We compute and store the centroids of each polygon in the dataframe, so that they serve as the reference point for isochrone computation in the following stages.


#### Initialisation of the ORS client
After having made sure that the range_val and interval_val values are numeric, the script initializes an ORS client using the base URL defined earlier. This client serves as an interface for sending requests to ORS and receiving responses in the form of geographic data.

#### Iterative computation of isochrones
In this section, the core of the script is implemented: a loop that iterates over each centroid and sends a request to ORS to get the isochrone for that location.
In order to do this, the longitude and latitude of each centroid are extracted. The script also assigns a unique identifier to each spatial unit (“carreau”), which allows for the results to be linked back to the original dataset.
For each centroid, the script sends a request to ORS specifying the following parameters:
The transportation profile (car-driving, foot-walking or cycling-regular).
The starting location as a pair of longitude and latitude coordinates.
The range (maximum travel time in seconds).
The interval (steps at which isochrones are computed).
If the request is successful, the response is stored as a JSON object. The result includes the isochrone geometry, the “carreaux” unit unique identifier, and additional metadata. This response is then added to the output file. If an error occurs, the script logs the error and proceeds to the next centroid. Computation continues even if results fail to be generated for some locations.
Each line in the final JSONL file corresponds to one isochrone for a specific “carreau” unit.

#### Post-processing: converting JSONL to GeoDataFrame
Each isochrone response contains a “features” key, which includes a polygon representing the isochrone (the geometry) and associated metadata. We use a command line tool "pv" that converts line by line the JSONL file into the necessary JSON format inorder for python code to correctly interpret. The script now loops through each line in the JSONL file and extracts these features. Each GeoJSON unit is uniquely identified by its Idcar_200m. 
Once all the isochrone features have been extracted, the isochrones geometries (stored as JSON) are then converted into actual geometric objects using shapely.shape(). This leads the geometry column to now contain actual polygon objects instead of raw JSON. The script then constructs a GeoDataFrame using GeoPandas. A “profile” column is added to this dataframe in order to store the transportation mode on which each isochrone is based. The script also makes sure that the isochrones remain linked to the original “carreau” they take as reference through a unique identifier for the spatial unit.  GeoJSON data uniquely processes bounding box and location data, so we needed to convert the "locations" to a string in order for the centroid of each carreau to be included in the conversion from JSONL to GeoJSON.
A GeoDataFrame is used in this context as this type of Pandas DataFrame supports geospatial operations. It ensures compatibility with mapping softwares and spatial analysis tools, which allows for easy visualisation of the computed isochrones in mapping softwares or GeoPandas-based Python scripts.

#### Post-processing: Generating scores at the carreaux level and storing results
1. Flatten Isochrone data to extract the unique identifier for carreau, our base unit
2. Compute a "within" spatial join of all BPE points within an isochrone. Isochrones represent time and travel mode parameters, so we have nine scores per carreau. Since the each carreau has multiple isochrones and there is a score column per isochrone, the script pivots the data to build these columns. In Python, spatial joins are single threaded functions, which creates a significant bottleneck when dealing with large datasets. So, we implement multithreadign to process chunks of the spatial join in parallel. The virtual machine we used contains 40 vCPU, so we were able to perform 160 jobs in unison, significantly reducing process time.
3. Join isochrone data on socio-economic data from INSEE
4. Save as GeoJSON file to be uploaded to a MongoDB database. We also process the "location" feature to reconvert it from a string back to a list. Due to the size of the resulting GeoJSON files, and to allow for dynamic user input, we installed a MongoDB database to store our geographic data. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that stores JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. This allows for necessary flexiblity in the storing of geojson data and quick response rate to pull large queries of geographic data. Each region's dataset is saved in its own collection following a dashed naming convention that removes special characters and accents (i.e. Pays de la Loire -> "pays-de-la-loire", La Réunion -> "la-reunion").
